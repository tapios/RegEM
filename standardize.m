function [x, xm, xs] = standardize(x, scale)
%STANDARDIZE   Centers and normalizes data.
%
%    [XC, XM, XS] = STANDARDIZE(X) centers and normalizes the data in X to
%    XC by subtracting the mean XM of each column and dividing each
%    column by its standard deviation XS. If X contains missing
%    values, indicated by NaNs, the mean and standard deviation of X
%    are computed from the available data.
%
%    [XC, XM, XS] = STANDARDIZE(X, SCALE) centers and normalizes the data
%    in X to zero mean and standard deviation SCALE. The column means
%    are returned as XM and the scale factors as XS = std(X) ./ SCALE.
%
%    Constant columns of X are not scaled.

%    See also CENTER, NANMEAN, MEAN, NANSTD, STD.
